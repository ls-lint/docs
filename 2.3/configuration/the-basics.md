# The Basics

## Creating configuration

Your ls-lint configuration should be located in a `.ls-lint.yml` file in your project **root** directory and provides two options:

<div style="color:#A2A2A2; font-size:12px;">
    .ls-lint.yml
</div>

```yaml
ls: ...

ignore: ...
```

`ls` defines the structure of your project directories with all their rules for your extensions, sub-extensions and directories while `ignore` can ignore some of these files and directories completely

:::tip Pro Tip
You can change the location of your `.ls-lint.yml` file and your work directory with the cli options: [Options](/2.3/configuration/the-command-line-interface.md#options.md)
:::

## Extensions & sub-extensions

You might ask yourself - what the hell are sub-extensions? ls-lint describes file extensions like `.js` or `.html` as extensions while `.d.ts`, `.umd.js` or `.local.build.js` file extensions are described as sub-extensions.

:::tip Wildcard extensions
You can also use wildcard extensions to simplify your configuration: [Wildcard extensions](/2.3/configuration/the-basics.md#linting-wildcard-extensions)

## Global configuration

A global configuration for your project is optional, but could be the best solution. Imagine you want to define that **all** of your `.js`, `.ts` and `.d.ts` project files must be named in the `kebab-case` style, but you want to ignore your `.git` and `node_modules` directories - this can be solved like this:

<div style="color:#A2A2A2; font-size:12px;">
    .ls-lint.yml
</div>

```yaml
ls:
  .js: kebab-case
  .ts: kebab-case
  .d.ts: kebab-case

ignore:
  - .git
  - node_modules
```

Pretty easy, isn`t it?

:::tip Rules Rules Rules
Don`t worry, there are many more rules to use: [All rules](/2.3/configuration/the-rules.md)
:::

## Linting directory names

You also can define rules for directories by the `.dir` definition

```yaml
ls:
  packages/src:
    .dir: kebab-case # applies to the current directory and all their subdirectories
    .js: kebab-case
```

## Linting wildcard extensions

You can use wildcard extensions for files in your **ls** configuration. With this support, you are no longer forced to add any possible file extension to your .ls-lint.yml configuration file, for instance:

```yaml
ls:
  .*: snake_case # match all extensions but .js and .*.js files
  .js: kebab-case # match all .js files
  .*.js: kebab-case # match all .*.js files (e.g. .test.js, .service.js)
```

## Using multiple rules

Sometimes, you need to accept multiple rules for a single file extension - This can be easily solved by the `|` operator:

<div style="color:#A2A2A2; font-size:12px;">
    .ls-lint.yml
</div>

```yaml
ls:
  .js: kebab-case | camelCase | PascalCase
```

## Different rules for different directories

Pretty often, there are different rules for different directories or you just want to define rules only for some specific directories:

<div style="color:#A2A2A2; font-size:12px;">
    .ls-lint.yml
</div>

```yaml
ls:
  .js: kebab-case

  models:
    .js: PascalCase

  src/templates:
    .js: snake_case
```

:::warning Keep in mind
Directory configurations like `models` or `src/templates` will override **all** rules for the current directory and all their subdirectories.
Please see the [Using directory patterns](#using-directory-patterns) section to configure wildcard subdirectories.

## Using directory patterns

### The glob pattern

The glob pattern `*` or `**` can be used for all of your **ls** and **ignore** directory configurations:

<div style="color:#A2A2A2; font-size:12px;">
    .ls-lint.yml
</div>

```yaml
ls:
  packages/*/src: # matches any sequence of non-path-separators
    .js: kebab-case

  packages/**/templates: # matches any sequence of characters, including path separators
    .html: kebab-case

ignore:
  - "**/*.png"
  - bazel-*
```

The glob pattern also provides the ability to override subdirectories:

```yaml
ls:
  packages/*: # applies to packages/**
    .dir: kebab-case
    .js: kebab-case

    "*": # applies to packages/*/**
      .dir: snake_case
      .js: kebab-case
```

### The alternative pattern

The alternative pattern can be used for all of your **ls** and **ignore** directory configurations:

<div style="color:#A2A2A2; font-size:12px;">
    .ls-lint.yml
</div>

```yaml
ls:
  packages/*/{src,tests}: # matches a sequence of characters if one of the comma-separated alternatives matches
    .js: kebab-case

ignore:
  - "**/{a,b}/*.js"
```

The alternative pattern also provides the ability to selectively override subdirectories:

```yaml
ls:
  packages/*: # applies to packages/**
    .dir: kebab-case
    .js: kebab-case

    "{src,tests}": # applies to packages/*/src, packages/*/src/**, packages/*/tests and packages/*/tests/**
      .dir: snake_case
      .js: kebab-case
```
