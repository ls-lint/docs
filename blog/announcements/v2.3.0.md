# Introducing [ls-lint](https://github.com/loeffel-io/ls-lint) v2.3.0

Today, we are celebrating 5 years of ls-lint and more than 7 million downloads with the v2.3.0 release.

## Prologue

Around 5 years ago, something weird happened. The coronavirus changed the world overnight. Pretty intimidated and scared, I packed
my bag and left Berlin for some weeks to move to my ex-girlfriend in Kiel, in north Germany. Together, on 30 square
meters, no toilet paper, and a self-constructed book desk for both of us, the next few days were very easy to predict.

At this time, I worked with a small team of around 5 to 8 devs.
Our monorepo was a nightmare: everyone did what they wanted.
I was pretty bored, so I decided to put an end to it.
In around 3 days, I created this thing called ls-lint, a small tool to lint your project filesystem.

Within hours, this small tool received hundreds of GitHub stars and Reddit upvotes. In no more than a few
hours, [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803) accepted my pull request to include ls-lint into Vue.js 2 — pretty sure
I will never forget this feeling (thank you, Evan).

Today we are celebrating 7 million ls-lint downloads. It's beautiful to see that ls-lint is used by some of the largest
open source projects and companies on our planet. With this, I am happy to announce ls-lint `v2.3.0` — the by far biggest
update yet.

## What the heck is ls-lint?

ls-lint is an extremely fast directory and filename linter that brings some structure to your project filesystem in an
easy way

```yaml
ls:
  packages/*/{src,__tests__}:
    .js: kebab-case
    .ts: camelCase | PascalCase
    .d.ts: camelCase
    .spec.ts: camelCase | PascalCase
    .mock.ts: camelCase

  components/*:
    .ts: regex:${0}
    tests:
      .*: exists:0
      .test.ts: regex:${1}

ignore:
  - node_modules
```

## What's new in `v2.3.0`

ls-lint `v2.3.0` comes with the most requested features from our community.

### Allow specifying individual files and directories and error output format

With [#215](https://github.com/loeffel-io/ls-lint/pull/215) and [#216](https://github.com/loeffel-io/ls-lint/pull/216)
it is now possible to run ls-lint on individual files and directories and return the error output in the JSON format.
This opens the world for tools like [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged)
and [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky).
Aside from that, this closes the gap for future IDE plugins (feel free to contact me).

```bash
ls-lint --error-output-format json file-1.js file-2.js
```

### Wildcard extension support

By [#217](https://github.com/loeffel-io/ls-lint/pull/217) it is now possible to use wildcard extensions for files.
With this support, you are no longer forced to add any possible file extension to your `.ls-lint.yml` configuration
file, for instance:

```yaml
ls:
  .go: snake_case
  .pb.go: snake_case
  .pb.validate.go: snake_case
  .json: snake_case
  .yaml: snake_case
  .tf: snake_case
  .yml: snake_case
  .bzl: snake_case
  .sh: snake_case
  .proto: snake_case
  .js: snake_case
  .service.js: snake_case
  .vue: PascalCase
  .ts: snake_case
  .html: snake_case
  .md: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

  components/**/{auth,account}:
    .js: snake_case
    .vue: PascalCase
    .ts: snake_case
    .html: snake_case
```

can be now minimized to this configuration file:

```yaml
ls:
  .*: snake_case
  .*.js: snake_case
  .*.*.go: snake_case # or .*.*.* or pb.*.go ...
  .md: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

  components/**/{auth,account}:
    .*: snake_case
    .vue: PascalCase
```

### Exists rule

[#223](https://github.com/loeffel-io/ls-lint/pull/223) ships the `exists` rule. Now it's possible to allow or disallow
_`N`_ or _`N-M`_ files for a given extension, which brings a variety of configuration options.
The exists rule only applies to the directory itself, not to subdirectories.

Imagine you want to restrict all component subdirectories to only having one `.ts` and one `.test.ts` file:

```yaml
ls:
  components/*:
    .dir: kebab-case
    .*: exists:0
    .ts: kebab-case | exists:1
    .test.ts: kebab-case | exists:1
```

`exists` also works for directories:

```yaml
ls:
  components/{auth,account}:
    dir: exists
    .*: ...

    "*":
      .dir: exists:0 # no subdirectories allowed
```

and ranges:

```yaml
ls:
  .foo: exists:1-10
```

### Extending configurations

This feature already landed in `v2.2.0`, but never got documented. That being said, I'm trying to catch it up here.
The `--config` option now provides a way to specify a custom path for your ls-lint configuration yml or yaml file:

```bash
ls-lint --config .ls-lint.(yml|yaml)
```

But it gets better: it is now possible to specify _`N`_ `--config` options that can be merged together.

Imagine you want to have one global configuration for your company, but still want to have a configuration in your
repository that can override or extend your base company configuration:

```yaml
# company .ls-lint.yml base configuration

ls:
  .go: snake_case
  .js: kebab-case
  .ts: kebab-case

ignore:
  - node_modules
```

```yaml
# repository .ls-lint.yml configuration

ls:
  components:
    .vue: kebab-case
```

A good approach for sharing your company `.ls-lint.yml` base configuration would be a designated GitHub repository or
NPM package.

With that being said, it's now possible to run ls-lint with a combination of both of your .ls-lint.yml configuration
files:

```bash
ls-lint --config node_modules/@your-company/ls-lint-global-config/.ls-lint.yml --config .ls-lint.yml
```

### Regex negation

[#288](https://github.com/loeffel-io/ls-lint/pull/288) ships the `regex` rule with negation support.
You can now negate the regex rule by adding a `!` prefix

```yaml
ls:
  .js: regex:![0-9]+ # the final regex pattern will be ^[0-9]+$
```

### Regex directory substitutions

[#289](https://github.com/loeffel-io/ls-lint/pull/289) ships the `regex` rule with directory substitution support.
The regex rule exposes the directory tree as substitution variables that can be referenced in the regex pattern.
For instance, you can use `${0}` to substitute the parent directory, `${1}` for the parent parent, and so on.

```text
components
└── button
    ├── button.ts
    └── tests
        └── button.test.ts
```

```yaml
ls:
  components/*: # e.g.: components/button
    .ts: regex:${0} # e.g.: components/button/button.ts
    .*.scss: regex:${0} # e.g.: components/button/button.module.scss

    tests:
      .test.ts: regex:${1} # e.g.: components/button/tests/button.test.ts
```

## Final Words

Thank you for reading, thank you for all the contributions, and feel free to clean up your project filesystem
